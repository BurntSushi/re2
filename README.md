Regular expression library written in Rust. Based on RE2.

Currently focusing on hitting feature parity with RE2. (I think this is 
actually pretty much done.)

No benchmarks yet. It's likely pretty slow.

More importantly, no tests yet.

There's no public API yet. See tests in `src/lib.rs` if you want to try it out.
